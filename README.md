# Chess Variants
**Made with Java Swing & ❤️ by Miklós Bácsi**

## About
This is an amazing program that allows you to **play chess variants locally** with your friends, your cat (or with yourself), and you can analyze the matches manually with the help of annotations!

The Game History offers you a memorable experience as you can replay your previous matches (with ← and →), and you can even see the game from the perspective of other players!

### Supported Variants:
- Classical
- Fog of War
- Duck Chess
- Crazyhouse
- Chaturaji (4-player)

(The help menu is super useful, so feel free to check it out!)
